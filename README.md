# Recipebook

This is a recipebook app I created to practice my hand at Meteor, a full-stack frameworks that makes creating apps very easy.

## About the app

This app provider a realtime CRUD interface for recipes. Recipes can be added to the current menu, which also adds the ingredients listed in the recipe to the shopping cart.

## Running a local version of the app

Make sure you have [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) installed.

Clone this repository and run `meteor npm install` to install some npm packages.

Then run `meteor` to start the Meteor server at `localhost:3000`.

NOTE : The `meteor` command might take some time to fire up the server first time, because it needs to install all the required Atmosphere packages to function correctly.
